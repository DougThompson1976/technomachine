# technomachine

Requires Sonic Pi 2.11.1 (a version that supports receiving OSC messages) and Processing 3 (with OscP5 and ControlP5 libraries) in order to run. 

Techno Machine is a simple synth app made with Sonic Pi and Processing. It includes 4 drum channels, patterns and kits, a synth with two oscillators and really simple filter and amplitude controls. The most fun part of it is the 8-step note sequencer! Just hit randomize and create new note sequences on fly!
